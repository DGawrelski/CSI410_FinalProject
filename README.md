# CSI410_FinalProject
My final project for CSI410, a basic web app that interfaces with a MySQL database.

The idea is a fictional service called Transit, which would theoretically act similar to New York's E-ZPass.

E-ZPass provides an alternative to paying for toll roads with physical cash by instead providing a scannable pass that contains
  information for the owner's account. The account is then charged a fee based on what the fee would normally be for the toll 
  road. E-ZPass basically acts like a debit/credit card for toll roads.

If there exists a real service called Transit which operates in a similar fashion, it is purely a coincidence and any type of 
  copyright or trademark infractions are not intended in any way.
